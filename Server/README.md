## Requirements

- Node v16.x.x

## Steps

- After the proceeding steps the server will be listening for HTTP request messages on port 5000.

1. Open the `Server` directory inside a terminal.
2. Execute `npm install`.
3. Execute `node app.js`.

## Errors

- If the port is already occupied run command `npx kill-port 5000` on any terminal.

## Notes

- The current Server abstraction is just a prototype. Ideally the generation functionality will be partitioned into its own JavaScript file and each template will be handled independently inside its own function.
