# CLIENT INSTRUCTIONS

## Requirements

- Node v16.15.1

## Steps

1. Open the `Client` directory inside a terminal.
2. Execute `npm install --force`.
3. Execute `npm run serve`.
4. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`

- After the preceding steps a development server will host the front-end logic on port 8080.

## Errors

- If the port is already occupied run command `npx kill-port 8080` on any terminal.
- The current `package.json` is experiencing build issues related to the vuetify library due to an npm update. Ignore the warnings issued by npm after `npm install --force` for the time being.

## Notes

- N/A
